AlphabetGame
============
**Description**
  
  This is a video game which pits a number of players against each other in their knowledge of animals.
  On each player's turn, they are asked for the name of an animal that starts with a specific letter.
  This letter starts off on the letter 'A', and goes to the next letter everytime a player can't think of an animal.
  
  PyGame 1.9.1 is required to run the latest version.
  Python 2.7 is required to run all versions.
  
  This game is currently in Alpha. The current version is Main2.py.
  A text based version is available as AlphabetTest.py.
  If you wish to play the game without the menus, but still have graphics, you may instead run GameOLD.py, however, it is likely to have many bugs.
  
  - Note: AlphabetTest.py does not connect to the Catalogue of Life Database.
  
Future Plans
============
  * Better backgrounds. Currently, there is only a white background for all menus, and a green background for the game.

  * Custom music.

   - Game music.
  * Clean up the folder.
